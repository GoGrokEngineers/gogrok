Gogrok: Competitive Coding Arena

🎯 Project Overview
  Welcome to Competitive Coding Arena — a dynamic platform that brings friendly competition to Data Structures and Algorithms enthusiasts. Think of it as a gamified       version of LeetCode, but tailored for private challenges with friends and colleagues. Engineers can now compete in real-time, sharpen their coding skills, and brag      about their victories! 🚀
  

👾 Core Features

  Create Your Room: Spin up a private coding room with a unique PIN and share it with your friends.
  Time-Bound Challenges: Set a timer and battle to solve a random algorithmic problem within the deadline.
  Real-Time Competition: Compete live and track who cracks the problem first.
  Python-Only (for Now): Currently, solutions must be written in Python — other languages like Java and Go are coming soon in the next release.


🥇 Future Roadmap

  We're not just about speed; quality matters too! In upcoming releases, expect:
  
  Advanced Scoring: Winners determined by:
  Code Complexity: Analysis of Big O notation.
  Solution Quality: Elegance and maintainability of the code.
  Multi-Language Support: Challenges in Java and Go.
  Leaderboard: Global rankings based on performance across multiple challenges.
